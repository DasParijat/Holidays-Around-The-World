# Holidays Around The World

## Background
This full-stack website, built using NodeJS, was me and my classmate's Software Development II project at Marist University during the Fall 2024 Semester. The course was centered around learning full-stack development, using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and NodeJS.

## Description
Holidays Around The World is meant to display a list of holidays currently going on from around the world. It does this mainly by calling this API (date.nager.at/Api) for data on Holidays that are on the current day. 

## State of Project + Future Plans
While the main function of it displaying holidays works, the registration/log in aspect do not work. I don't intend on polishing THIS version of HatH much besides cleaning up code occasionally, however I may attempt to remake the site as a seperate project.

## How to run it
Make sure to have NodeJS downloaded and downloaded the node modules for it. Then run it by running this command in a terminal,
- npm start
